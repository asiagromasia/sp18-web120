    <p>Hi there! My name is Joanna and I love the positive outcome of challenges. If there is a negative one, I just keep on trying again and again, and again- till eventually I turn it to learning lesson. However if some of the attempts turn to positive outcome- that's what I love the most! Well deserved satisfaction. </p> <p>Now you can see why I know that programming is the right carrier for me...</p>
    <p>Orchids are known for one of the most difficult plants to maintain. This, plus their unique beauty, rear blooming and fragrance (yes! some of them are extremely fragrant) makes them object of my desire.</p>
    <p>Currently I'm experimenting with their environment, some are in leca beads and some without soil at all- just water for couple days (Semi Water Culture-SWC) or all the time(FWC). 
    <p>Can't wait to see the outcomes!</p>
